# cloudpath

Inspired by Dylan Moriarty's [Foggy Spaces](https://dylanmoriarty.github.io/blog/foggy-spaces.html) project, this map uses turf.js and Mapbox Draw to allow you to create your own cloudy pathway.

Additionally, this map demonstrates how to create a dynamic masking effect on Mapbox maps.
